# High Issues

## H-1: Unsafe Casting

Downcasting int/uints in Solidity can be unsafe due to the potential for data loss and unintended behavior.When downcasting a larger integer type to a smaller one (e.g., uint256 to uint128), the value may exceed the range of the target type,leading to truncation and loss of significant digits. Use OpenZeppelin's SafeCast library to safely downcast integers.

	```

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```

## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

	```solidity
	        bool success = EGGS.transfer(msg.sender, eggAmount);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

## L-4: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	  function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
